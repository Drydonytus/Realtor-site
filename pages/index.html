            When <a href="sell.html">SELLING</a> a house, Go Flat Fee offers TWO
            ways to help.
          </h4>
          <p>
            <strong
              >1. If you would like to sell a house that IS marketable to the
              general public</strong
            >, Go Flat Fee charges a LOW, AFFORDABLE, FLAT FEE to represent you.
            On a house selling for $400,000, the home seller who works with Go
            Flat Fee will typically save approximately
            <strong>$8,000.00</strong> in real estate commissions over the fees
            charged by traditional real estate agents. This reduced real estate
            fee gives the homeowner <strong>options</strong>. The homeowner can
            pocket the additional money <strong>OR</strong> consider lowering
            the sales price to be more competitive in the market
            <strong>OR</strong> offer a higher commission to any Realtor who
            procures a buyer. Our reduced fees when selling a house ultimately
            gives the homeowner the best opportunity to make as much money as
            quickly as possible when selling.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >2. If you as a home seller have a house that is NOT marketable to
              the general public</strong
            >
            due to condition, time frame, or other conditions, Go Flat Fee
            offers a purchase program. Go Flat Fee will thoroughly inspect the
            property and, in many cases, make an offer to purchase the property
            <strong>ASIS</strong>. This offer will be a fair offer based on the
            current condition of the property, and can potentially be a very
            good solution for the home seller. This can help homeowners who are
            having to deal with properties which are behind on payments, need
            extensive repairs, need to be sold very quickly, or have otherwise
            become a “headache” property.

            When <a href="buy.html">BUYING</a> a house, consider the two
            following, important ways Go Flat Fee saves our clients money.

          <p>
            <strong
              >1. It costs NOTHING to work with Go Flat Fee as a Buyer.</strong
            >
            Think about that. You receive expert, professional, real estate
            services, and it costs you NOTHING out of pocket. The individual
            selling the house pays the fee to Go Flat Fee even though we
            represent YOU.

              a home using our services.</strong

            Think about that. Not only does it cost you NOTHING to have us on
            your side with our knowledge and experience, but Go Flat Fee also
            REBATES TO YOU <strong>up to 25%</strong> of the commissions we
            receive from the seller of the property.
